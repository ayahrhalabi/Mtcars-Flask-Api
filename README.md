# Homework 3

Use the mtcars.csv dataset to create a predictive linear model using `mpg` as a response and any (or all) other remaining variables as predictors using Python in a Docker container. 

# Repo Breakdown: 

- mpgpredictions.py <- Linear Regression model that is being deployed.
- mtcars.csv <- Data used for the model
- requirments.txt <- the packages and versions required for our docker image
- server.py <- Flask API App
- Example.md <- Example on how to run the model locally
- docker-compose.yml 
- Docker file
